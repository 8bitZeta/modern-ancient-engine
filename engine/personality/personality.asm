/*
	This function is called to snag the ability of a Pokémon given a personality value in bc. It will then return the
	ability in bc, which in turn is stored in either [wPlayerAbility] or [wEnemyAbility] outside of this function.

	These RAM bytes need to be reserved for futureproofing, as the ability of a Pokémon can change through Trace,
	Gastro Acid, Simple Beam, Mummy, Skill Swap, etc. As a note, these abilities, WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS, are in a Gen
	IV state. Guides on how to implement later generation ability logic will eventually be posted on the Wiki pages
	located at https://github.com/8bitZeta/modern-ancient-engine/

/*
	For ALL of these functions below, the current Pokémon's ability is usually loaded in bc, and the opposing Pokémon's 
	ability is loaded into de. There are some exceptions to the rule:
		- For HP activated abilities, the current Pokémon's HP is stored in de instead of the opposing mon's ability.
		- For Guts, Marvel Scale, and Tangled Feet, the user status is stored in de.
		- For Steadfast and Anger Point, a 1-bit flag is stored in de if the user flinched or suffered a critical hit,
		  respectively.
		- For Color Change, the damaging move type is loaded into de instead of the opposing mon's ability.
		- For Shadow Tag and Arena Trap, the opposing mon types are stored in de, and the opposing mon ability is
		  pushed onto the stack.
		- Pickup and Honey Gather care about the [wPartyMonX] abilities, and compare all party Pokémon abilities.
		  Understandably, this means all calculations are done locally and nothing needs to be presumed.
		- For passive abilities outside of battle, the calculation is done inside of that function on [wPartyMon1].
